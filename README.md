# Final Project - CI/CD Deployment

This repository contains the final project for the PSO (Pengantar Sistem Operasi) course. The focus of this project is to implement and demonstrate **CI/CD deployment** practices in a real-world scenario using modern development tools and environments.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

In this project, our team built a simple web-based application and integrated a full CI/CD pipeline. This includes:
